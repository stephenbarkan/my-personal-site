title: My feelings about social media and how they shaped the design choices I made on this website

My relationship with social media is unhealthy: I let myself be distracted by it when I shouldn't, and that happening bothers me a lot. I believe that I shouldn't use it so when I do I feel guilt. I recognize that I have the opinion that social media is having an overall bad impact on the world and as such I shouldn't participate in it.

I've also always felt uncomfortable about externally communicating praise for myself, but social media makes me want to that, sharing choice photos of myself or the music and art I make. Then I feel guilty about how I want to participate but am uncomfortable about doing the participating and the whole thing becomes overwhelming and I try not to think about it that much.

My current social media experience is:

- I have an Instagram account but don't upload anything to it. I say I want to keep it because I can use it as a platform – I used it a few times during the elections to share voting encouragement content. I've uninstalled the app from my phone but still check it on the desktop about once a week.
- I deleted my Twitter account and was completely off of the platform for a while. Then I realized that Twitter was the best place to find communicaton relevant to my hobbies, and it became too tedious to not have an account but still try to read things on the site. So I created a _secret account_ where I don't have a photo and don't follow any people in my life, just the accounts for my design and development hobbies. Occasionally I read news headlines there too, but I never get joy from that part of having a Twitter account again.

Anyway, the point is I think the reason I decided to design this website where each section resembles some sort of social media or computer UI concept is in part because it gives me a space to share information about myself in a semi-private place that still resembles the activity of participating in the real thing without some of the anxiety triggered in me by social media.

Also, the fact that the website and its contents are shared publically encourages me to put a lot of joyful energy into making it represent me in as full of an image as I want the online world to have. I've been very particular and precise about how the information is communicated on this website, and by doing that I've packaged this information about myself in a way that says even more about myself. When people use Twitter to share a thought, they are also communicating something about themselves (what reasons would someone have for sharing a thought on Twitter but not on Instagram?) in their choice to use Twitter as the vessel for their message. My choice to share things about myself in a space I designed too says something about me. I don't know exactly what that message is since that will ultimately be up to you to interpret it, but if I had to guess it's that I'm a bit weird for creating a whole website to share things about myself when I could very easily use social media!
