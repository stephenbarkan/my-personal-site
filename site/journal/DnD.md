title: Our DnD Story
date: 2020-05-02

> My friends and I have been playing a DnD campaign lately. Below is an account of the events that have happened thus far. All the illustrations were drawn by Colin Seikel!

The story begins in Velon, a bustling skyport city where magic and technology are fully intertwined with daily life, which serves as the main shipping artery to the prefectorial capital, Asteria. You’ll regularly catch an Artificer mechanic working on an airship or a Warforged police android patrolling the criminal hotbeds. Being the main port in and out of the capital, Velon gets traffic from political and religious figures, vacationers, and criminals alike.

*The party, a real group of misfits*

### Session 1: 02/23/2020
* The Party is formed at the Seared Rapscallion:
	* Davey Jonas enters the Seared Rapscallion and witnesses two elves in suits coercing Olric, the bartender, into selling them the bar. They leave after making a vague threat that he’d regret not doing it.
	* E’dun stops a peacekeeper from taking the medication from a guy, but does so by throwing the pills in the water.
	* Yselda is peer-pressured into checking out the Seared Rapscallion by her annoying friend Ashley.
	* Rusty finds out he has lost his job as a pipe mechanic since the shop is closing down. He heads over to the Seared Rapscallion to have one last beer with his boss.
	* Reniya puts on a controversial performance piece at a nearby warehouse, taking a stand against the gentrification that she’s also a part of. To celebrate after, she heads to the Seared Rapscallion.
	* Streex is chilling out and is approached by Scary Face McGee and Larry Face McGee, two mobsters, who hire him to help them with a job, where they have to cause a scene at the Seared Rapscallion.
* Scary Face smashes Streex over the head with a bottle and a bar fight breaks out. Eventually two Peacekeepers show up to quell the fight, but E’dun puts everyone to sleep and then convinces them that he’s an undercover cop who has the situation under control and they leave the bar with Scary Face in custody.

### Session 2: 03/01/2020
* Everyone wakes up the next day confused about what happened. E’dun explains the previous night’s events and we decide to follow the instructions given to Larry Face to meet in the steam pipes system to retrieve the payment for the job. 
* While waiting for the meeting to happen, we split up to go about our days:
	* Yselda goes to work at the newspaper and overhears her coworkers talking about how lots of bars in the pirate area of the city are being shut down after being deemed dangerous locations by Mayor Pringlepuff and the Peacekeepers.
	* Rusty, Streex, and Larry Face head into the steam pipes to scope out the location of the transaction. When they find the location, Rusty stays behind to plant bombs around the room, and Streex and Larry Face go back to the Toasty Tuna Towers, where Yselda and Ashley live.
	* Reniya, E’dun, and Davey create a contraption to lift one of Reniya’s many yachts onto the roof of the Toasty Tuna Towers and into the rooftop pool. They saw off the top level to create our new base of operations.
* At 6:30, an hour before the designated meeting time, we grow tired of waiting and decide to head over to the steam tunnels early to hide before the arrival of the others. But our presence is known, and we get ambushed by a shadowy figure, who takes the form of Scary Face McGee, and three ninjas. A chaotic fight breaks out in the dark of the tunnels – things seem to not be going well.

### Session 3: 03/08/2020
* Reniya casts `Friends` on the shadowy figure, who then agrees to leave us alone under the condition that we never speak of the events to anyone. Reniya agrees and the enemies vanish.
* As we’re recovering from the fight, we discover that we literally cannot talk about what just happened, and then whenever we do, we are afflicted by a curse placed on us by the shadowy figure (who we now affectionately refer to as Airy Face McGee).
* We return to the Toasty Tuna Towers to rest and heal our wounds for the night. While most of the party sleeps, E’dun stays up all night, ruminating over how to release the curse. He realizes that we must seek out his mother, a priestess of the Drow, for counsel. 
* The next morning, we head over to the Drow temple in two vehicles. First, one of Reniya’s limos, and second, a small car driven recklessly by Streex. Streex doesn’t know how to get to the temple so it takes him, Rusty, and Ashley much longer to arrive than the rest of the party. 
* At the temple, Yselda and Kim Chi (Reniya’s pet red panda) help a sacrificial sheep escape from the altar. Streex skids up to the temple at the exact moment the sheep is fleeing and nearly runs it over. With all of us reunited, we head over to the recreation center where we meet E’dun’s mother, Nufkat. She tells us that to perform the spell necessary to break the curse, we would need to acquire three ingredients from the criminal underbelly of Velon:
	1. abyssal smoke
	2. brimstone
	3. wyrmwood moonshine
* Reniya, who had a past life in the criminal underworld knows that the entrance to the black market is in the suburbs, so we head there. As we approach the entrance to the suburban steam tunnels, Reniya formulates a plan to get what we need. She confronts a mother taking her baby for a walk and requests to borrow the baby. Surprisingly, the mother agrees, and Reniya explains to us that she will use this baby to trick her ex-boyfriend, Jim, into thinking that she had a child with him, and then would use his guilt to make him give her the magical ingredients. What could go wrong!
* When we reach the market we find it abandoned. We start to investigate the empty stalls when we hear three Peacekeepers approaching, so we all hide – some better than others. Davey and Streex try to hide like mannequins in one of the stalls and manage to get the jump on the Peacekeepers, then we effortlessly destroys them, but not before Rusty and Davey deafen everyone by exploding a bunch of bombs. Catching our breath after the fight, we're snuck up on by mysterious masked figures.

### Session 4: 03/15/2020
* The head masked figure reveals herself to be one of Reniya’s old friends, Marienne Macabre. After curing our deafness, she explains that the criminal underworld had to clear out after Mayor Pringlepuff’s *Clean Up the Streets* initiative forced them to leave. But the society lives on, just further underground. We ask her to take us there, and she brings us down an elevator shaft into what appears to be a inside bay cave, where many shops are set up in a kind of canals system.
* E'dun wants to buy some poison to dip his sword into, so we find a poison-seller named Yulma, an old Dwarf crush of Rusty's from back in the day when they both were part of the Workers' Movement. Rusty tries to tell her how he feels about her but chokes and runs away.
* We find the Brothel-Chili's-Pirate-Bar where Jim works.
	* Streex and Yselda (who has transformed herself into a dog and can't un-transform) sneak into the kitchen and find the wormwood moonshine and other assorted liquors!
	* Reniya finds Jim, and although he doesn't fall for the baby trick, is sufficiently intimidated by Reinya and lets us know that he owes some money to Lester Sylvestor the Silver Investor who would know where the ingredients are and could supply us with them.

*Lester Sylvester the Silver Investor*

* We head to Lester's who tells us he'll give us what we're looking for if we play a match of "Hexagon," a capture-the-flag-like game played in an octagon-shaped arena, against a professional league team owned by Heckbeard, "Heckbeards's Frickboys" 

> It's explained that at some point in the recent past Hellbeard, the feared pirate and former ship captain of Davey has had a turn of heart and renamed himself "Heckbeard," refuses to curse anymore, and might even not be a pirate anymore.

* We battle the Frickbois and win in a close game. After the match Streex buys us all commemorative Heckbeard's Frickboys hats, and we go back to Sylvester's to retrieve the abyssal smoke and wyrmwood moonshine.

### Session 5: 03/22/2020
* Before we leave the underground, we all get group tattoos that improve our AC, and go to the Mustard Plug, for pickles. Davey gets a Rhinestone Duster and Streex gets rollerblades.
* We all go our separate ways to rest. 
	* Streex learns Giant language
	* Triggered by his embarassing encounter with Yulma, Rusty builds Yulma-bot, an anime body pillow waifu made of steel, and "marries" himself to it. Everyone is uncomfortable about this.

*Rusty proudly admiring his ~~creation~~ wife, Yulma-bot*

* The next day we return to the Drow temple and Nufkat uses the ingredients to release the curse. We each have a different reaction to the procedure based on the plane of existence we're from:
	* Reniya goes to another world and meets Zanthanar, a giant turtle
	* Rusty, Streex, and E'dun have a fever dream in which they perform a gem heist on an airship and kill Madame Blowhole, the head of Montgomery Logistics
	* Yselda sees a vision of her father dealing some sort of drug, and discovers that her mom was also involved with his shady dealings!
	* Toothy has one last encounter with Davey's sprit on the *Year 3000* (Davey's pirate ship).
* When the visions end and we return to reality, we're all cured of the infliction except for Davey, who is lying on the ground as a giant slug and a shadowy Dementor-type figure spew forth out of his mouth.

### Session 6: 04/04/2020
* We battle the dementor and giant slug and it is revealed that Davey has been dead the whole time, and only being controlled by Toothy, a necromancer parrot. The slug possessed his body during the battle, which made it so Toothy could no longer control his body.

*Toothy, the necromancer parrot*

* We all are deeply saddened by this revelation, so we decide to have a funeral for our old buddy Davey and take him down to the docks to have a viking funeral procession; however, as we pass the Seared Rapscallion we see that it has been condemned and shut down! We decide to investigate and see if we can figure out from Olrick what is going on with our favorite pirate bar.

### Session 7: 04/11/2020
* We investigate the bar but find no indication about what might have happened besides that Olrick likely wasn't there when the construction began. We go to Olrick's house and find that, too, abandoned. 
* We still have Davey's body so we head to the sea docks to send him off, and figure that we can talk to the other pirates that hang out there to find out if they have any info on what happened to Olrick.
* We meet Bing Bong Wallywag from the Herring & Hairing shop who explains that the whole port has been cleaned up, much like the suburban underground community. But instead of setting up shop elsewhere, the pirates of the sea docks went along with the changes and converted their businesses into legitimate enterprises – as a farmer's market!
* While we're at the port, Toothy and Streex go onto Heckbeard's ship to ask him if he could help us find Olrick. He sends us on a quest to retrieve a shipping license from Aldermon Demandry who used to run a high-value shipping route to a port across the desert. Once it became clear that the pirate shipping industry was getting hamstrung, he cut a deal with Montogmery Logistics to sell them information about the pirate operations. In exchange for retrieving the license, Heckbeard would help us look for Olrick. 
* While this meeting is happening, we meet Pablo Escojagaur, a drug-dealing cat monk who inexplicably decides to join our party and gives E'dun the same drug that Yselda's parents were dealing in vision.
* Reniya tries to steal another baby, Yselda stops her and then buys a "you are enough" pillow to make her feel like she's enough.
* Reniya attempts to steal *another* baby, Pablo stops her this time.
* We finally send off Davey Jonas, and Rusty and Yulma-bot invite everyone over for a dinner party at Reniya's second bunker home. Rusty can tell that there's some tension between Toothy and E'dun, who feels betrayed that all this time his friend, Davey, wasn't who he thought.
* Next day we meet at dawn and board an ornithopter called the Pterabarnacle, loaned to us by Heckbeard. We fly it out over the forest and approach the ship we're meant to intercept. E'dun and Toothy use the loadspeaker to convince the Giffs (bipedal hippos) operating the vessel that we are sent by Montgomery Logistics and need to check their paperwork. They're initially convinced, though wary, and let us board the ship. Reniya can't help herself and tries to pickpocket one of the Giffs. Naturally, a fight breaks out.

### Session 8: 04/18/2020
* The captain of the ship is a half dragon, who we discover is Florence Montgomery, the illegitimate son of Lawrence Montgomery, the founder of Montgomery Logistics. We brutally kill him and Toothy takes control of his body to use as a potential asset for later trickery. The crazy half of our party dynamic overpowers the reasonable side and we interrogate and kill most of the Giffs. Pablo even flamethrowers one and starts to eat it. 
* We find out from the Giffs that Airy Face McGee coerced them into selling out Heckbeard. We start to head back to Velon – on the way back, Rusty and Toothy confront the party about how our actions are starting to stray from being objectively "good," what with all of Reniya's baby stealing and Pablo's cannibalism. After the discussion the girls (including Yulma-bot) go into the captain's room and gossip while the guys all do LSD and start to understand each other better. 
* When we get back to Velon, Heckbeard tells us that he heard a report that somebody saw Olrick getting dragged out of his house by two Velon police officers and Peacekeepers, but his men on the inside of the detention center never see him arrive. In fact, not as many people who get arrested lately have been arriving to the detention center... 
* We decide that we have to visit Yselda's dad in prison, to see if maybe he has any information about what we've learned.
* We stop by the Toasty Tuna Towers to put Florence on ice and ask Secretary Face McGee to take care of him. While we have been on our adventures, Sectretary Face has become a wizard and casts a spell on the body so it can't decay.


### Session 9: 04/25/2020
* Most of us go to the jail, but Toothy and Streex return to Heckbeard's to ask him a few other questions.
* At the jail, Yselda meets her dad, Gorgo, for the first time in years and Reniya meets her friend, Mr. Sampson Onions. Gorgo knows nothing about the disappearances since he's been in jail for 15 years. 

![The prison warden and his giant robo-protector](/images/journal/dnd-warden.jpg)
*The prison warden and his giant robo-protector*

* Pablo tries to awaken the security droids to their oppressed state to no avail and the droids escort him out of the prison. Rusty and Reniya cause a ruckus and a full blown fight breaks out, with the warden and his giant robo-protector and the security droids fighting everyone in the visitation room. Feeling only a minor allegiance to help his new friends, Pablo turns to leave the prison but has a change of heart and returns to help us.
* Gorgo overpowers the prison warden and is able to shut off the security droids, giving us time to escape. Toothy, Streex, and Yulma-bot show up just in time in a stolen car and we make off into the sewers, narrowly escaping the police chasing us.
