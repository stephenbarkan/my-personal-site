*My friends and I have been playing a DnD campaign lately. Below is an account of the events that have happened thus far:*

### The Setting
The story begins in Velon, a bustling skyport city where magic and technology are fully intertwined with daily life, which serves as the main shipping artery to the prefectorial capital, Asteria. You’ll regularly catch an Artificer mechanic working on an airship or a Warforged police android patrolling the criminal hotbeds. Being the main port in and out of the capital, Velon gets traffic from political and religious figures, vacationers, and criminals alike.

*The party, a real group of misfits*

### Session 1: 02/23/2020
* The Party convenes at the Seared Rapscallion:
	* Davey Jonas enters the Seared Rapscallion and witnesses two elves in suits coercing Olric, the bartender, into selling them the bar. They leave after making a vague threat that he’d regret not doing it.
	* E’dun stops a peacekeeper from taking the medication from a guy, but does so by throwing the pills in the water.
	* Yselda is peer-pressured into checking out the Seared Rapscallion by her annoying friend Ashley.
	* Rusty finds out he has lost his job as a pipe mechanic since the shop is closing down. He heads over to the Seared Rapscallion to have one last beer with his boss.
	* Reniya puts on a controversial performance piece at a nearby warehouse, taking a stand against the gentrification that she’s also a part of. To celebrate after, she heads to the Seared Rapscallion.
	* Streex is chilling out and is approached by Scary Face McGee and Larry Face McGee, two mobsters, who hire him to help them with a job, where they have to cause a scene at the Seared Rapscallion.
* Scary Face smashes Street over the head with a bottle and a bar fight breaks out. Eventually two Peacekeepers show up to quell the fight, but E’dun puts everyone to sleep and then convinces them that he’s an undercover cop who has the situation under control and they leave the bar with Scary Face in custody.

### Session 2: 03/01/2020
* Everyone wakes up the next day confused about what happened. E’dun explains the previous night’s events and the party decides to follow the instructions given to Larry Face to meet in the steam pipes system to retrieve the payment for the job. 
* While waiting for the meeting to happen, the party splits up to go about their day:
	* Yselda goes to work at the newspaper and overhears her coworkers talking about how lots of bars in the pirate area of the city are being shut down after being deemed dangerous locations by Mayor Pringlepuff and the Peacekeepers.
	* Rusty, Streex, and Larry Face head into the steam pipes to scope out the location of the transaction. When they find the location, Rusty stays behind to plant bombs around the room, and Streex and Larry Face go to the Toasty Tuna Towers, where Yselda and Ashley live.
	* Reniya, E’dun, and Davey create a contraption to lift one of Reniya’s many yachts onto the roof of the Toasty Tuna Towers and into the rooftop pool. They saw off the top level to create the party’s new base of operations.
* At 6:30, and hour before the designated meeting time, the party grows tired of waiting and decides to head over to the steam tunnels early to hide before the arrival of the others. But their presence is known, and they get ambushed by a shadowy figure who takes the form of Scary Face McGee and three ninjas. A chaotic fight breaks out in the dark of the tunnels – things seem to not be going well.

### Session 3: 03/08/2020
* Reniya casts Friends on the shadowy figure, who then agrees to leave the party alone under the condition that they never speak of the events to anyone. Reniya agrees and the enemies vanish.
* As they’re recovering from the fight, the party discovers that they literally can not talk about what just happened, and then whenever they do, they are afflicted by a curse placed on them by the shadowy figure (who they affectionately refer to as Airy Face McGee).
* They return to the Toasty Tuna Towers to rest and heal their wounds for the night. While most of the party sleeps, E’dun stays up all night, ruminating over how to release the curse. He realizes that they must seek out his mother, a priestess of the Drow for counsel. 
* The next morning, the party heads over to the Drow temple in two vehicles. First, one of Reniya’s limos, and second, a small car driven recklessly by Streex. Streex doesn’t know how to get to the temple so it takes him, Rusty, and Ashley much longer to arrive than the rest of the party. 
* At the temple, Yselda and Kim Chi (Reniya’s pet red panda) help a sacrificial sheep escape from the altar. Streex skids up to the temple at the exact moment the sheep is fleeing and nearly runs it over.
* With the party reunited, they all head over to the recreation center where they meet E’dun’s mother, Nufkat. She tells them that to perform the spell necessary to break the curse, the party needs to acquire three ingredients from the criminal underbelly of Velon:
	1. abyssal smoke
	2. brimstone
	3. wyrmwood moonshine
* Reniya, who had a past life in the criminal underworld knows that the entrance to the black market is in the suburbs, so the party heads there.
* As they approach the entrance to the suburban steam tunnels, Reniya formulates a plan to get what they need. She approaches a mother taking her baby for a walk and requests to borrow the baby. Surprisingly, the mother agrees, and Reniya explains to the party that she will use the baby to trick her ex-boyfriend, Jim, into thinking that she had a child with him, and would use his guilt to make him give her the magical ingredients.
* When the party reaches the market they find it abandoned. They’re all confused and start to investigate the empty stalls when they hear three Peacekeepers approaching. They all hide – some better than others. Davey and Streex try to hide like mannequins in one of the stalls and manage to get the jump on the Peacekeepers. The party effortlessly destroys the robots, but not before Rusty and Davey deafen everyone by exploding a bunch of bombs.
* Catching their breath, the party is snuck up on by mysterious masked figures 

### Session 4: 03/15/2020
* The masked figure reveals herself to be one of Reniya’s old friends. After curing the party’s deafness, she explained that the criminal underworld had to clear out after Mayor Pringlepuff’s Clean Up the Streets initiative forced them out. But the culture lives on, just further underground. The group asked her to take us there, and she brought them down an elevator shaft into what appeared to be a inside bay cave, where many shops were set up in a kind of canals system.
