title: I moved to Chicago

After a year and a half of being in long distance relationship, I was finally able to move to Chicago! Our plan was originally that I would start searching for a job in Chicago in January 2020, six months before Eugenia’s lease ended, with the hope that I would find a job there before that time so we could get a new place together. I was nervous about the timing since it’s difficult to find a new job, especially when you don’t already live in the city it would be in. I was dreading the application and rejection process, knowing that we had a deadline to meet.

But back in October, I stumbled up on the [Doist](https://doist.com) website one night while Eugenia and I were on the phone. I was immediately taken by the design of the site and noticed they had an open remote position for a Marketing Designer, so of course I decided to apply. Fast forward two months and I figured out how I was going to get to Chicago, and six months earlier than expected (I got the job!)
The day before my birthday, Eugenia flew to Austin and we packed up all my things into the car. We drove up over a long weekend for our second ever road trip.

Our first stop was in Mt. Pleasant TX. I really wanted to stop in Texarkana because I always thought it was a funny name but we got too tired and didn’t make it all the way on the first night. I thought it would be fun to stay in a random roadside motel just for the experience of it, but Eugenia had other ideas and we stayed at a bougie Holiday Inn or something. It was really nice though. Those bedsheets ✨

The next day we ended in Memphis and had a great evening! We hung out on Beale street and saw this great couple band called Pam and Terry. They were really cute and Terry came around during a break and took photos of all the audience on a digital camera to post on their website. They sang this [original love song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YtTseNuu5E) called “If I had a Nickel” that made both Eugenia and me cry.

After that we went to the Grey Canary for a super fancy dinner subsidized by Doist for my birthday. We really balled out on drinks and delicious food.

The third day we drove to St. Louis but it was so cold that we just stayed in our Airbnb the whole night and watched The Circle. Finally, we spent the last day driving to Chicago and moved all my things into Eugenia’s apartment.

The first two months here have been fantastic and a great time overall with work and life. At the time of writing we’re now back in Austin for Coronavirus quarantining unfortunately, but hopefully we’ll be able to go back soon.
