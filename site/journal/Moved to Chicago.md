I moved to Chicago in January 2020. Eugenia flew to Austin and we packed up all my things into the car. We drove up over a long weekend and stopped in Mt. Pleasant TX, Memphis TN, St. Louis MO, and finally arrived in Chicago!

I love it here and am so happy. Here are some pics from my first two months here.
