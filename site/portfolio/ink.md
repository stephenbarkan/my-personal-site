excerpt: In 2018, INK repositioned itself as a communications partner for B2B tech companies; we needed to revamp our messaging and visual identity to better resonate with our ideal prospective clients. As INKâ€™s interactive designer, I led the project to refine our brand and design a new marketing website.
